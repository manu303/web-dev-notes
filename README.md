# Web Development Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning **JavaScript** and **MERN stack**.  
I will be adding daily notes, code snippets, and small practice projects here.

## How to use

- Each concept has its own folder with `.js` or `.md` files.
- Feel free to explore the code, but this repo is primarily for my learning progress.

## Goals

- Track daily learning and practice consistently.
- Build a solid foundation in JavaScript and MERN stack.
- Maintain a clean, organized structure for easy reference.
